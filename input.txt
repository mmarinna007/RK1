 getopt is used to break up options in command lines for easy parsing by shell procedures and to check for legal options. optstring is a string of recognized option letters; see getopt(3C). If a letter is followed by a colon (:), the option is expected to have an argument which may or may not be separated from it by white space. The special option - is used to delimit the end of the options. If it is used explicitly, getopt recognizes it; otherwise, getopt generates it; in either case, getopt places it at the end of the options. The positional parameters ($1 $2 ...) of the shell are reset so that each option is preceded by a - and is in its own positional parameter; each option argument is also parsed into its own positional parameter.
